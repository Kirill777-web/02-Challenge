# HORISEON WebPage

## Description

The motivation behind undertaking the code refactor on the digital marketing website was to enhance its overall performance, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. As a web developer, the goal was to optimize the existing codebase, improve accessibility. This project involved restructuring the HTML, CSS code to follow semantic elements, consolidate selectors, and eliminate redundancies.

The code refactor addresses several issues with the original website. Firstly, it improves the website's accessibility by using semantic HTML elements, making it more inclusive for users with disabilities and assistive technologies. Secondly, by consolidating CSS selectors and optimizing styles, the website's loading speed and performance are enhanced, leading to a better user experience.

Through this project, I learned the importance of code refactoring as a means to improve code quality and maintainability on HTML and CSS.This code refactor project reinforced the significance of writing clean, modular, and efficient code to create a more accessible, performant, and user-friendly digital marketing website.
